## About the Video Course
Unit testing allows the automation of the testing process and helps you discover errors contained in more complex pieces of the application. It enhances test coverage because attention is given to each unit. Writing unit tests will help you improve your JavaScript code before you even start writing it
This course will teach you to use unit testing in your JavaScript applications and covers tools and techniques you'll need to write unit tests for your code. You will learn how to handle data from different sources, test the application on different browsers, and also run it in the cloud. You will learn how to test applications using Jasmine, Mocha, Ava, Tape, and Intern.
By the end of the course, you will be able to perform unit testing using JavaScript to deliver better code.
